These scripts are used with Intune to make URL Shortcuts.

Quick Summary:
 - Use `install.bat` as *install command*
 - Use `uninstall.bat` as *Uninstall command*
 - Change the `$URL`, `$IconFileName`, and `$StorePath` variables in the PowerShell scripts to create different shortcuts.
 - Add an icon file `*.ico` if you want to use a custom icon.
